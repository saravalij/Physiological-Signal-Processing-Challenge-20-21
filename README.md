# Physiological-Signal-Processing-Challenge-20-21

The aim of this project is to come up with a solution to detect arrythmias in ICUs in a more efficient way. Many times, a monitor raises an arrythmia alarm even though the patient being monitored is not having an arrythmia. This causes additional stress to both patients and medical staff in ICUs, hospital stay durations might be increased and the staff might be being worn off. Therefore, it is of great importance to improve detection algorithms.
